# Muriel 

Developers, support, designers, growth — we all have the same goals:

Consistent, inclusive, beautiful design.

Efficient development and iteration.

Clean, stable code.

Delightful, intuitive, useful user experiences.

Products that work for people, so people don’t have to work at their products.

**There’s a system for that. It’s called Muriel.**
